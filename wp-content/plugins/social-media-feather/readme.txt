Super lightweight, simple, nice, modern looking and effective social sharing and following buttons and icons on your site without the extra burden

== Description ==

[WordPress Social Media Feather](http://synved.com/wordpress-social-media-feather/ "Lightweight WordPress social sharing and following") is a super lightweight free social media WordPress plugin that allows you to quickly and painlessly add **social sharing and following** features to all your posts, pages and custom post types.

Now the only social sharing and bookmarking plugin with full support for the **Retina and high resolution displays** as used in iPad 5 and other devices!

The primary goal behind the plugin is to provide very lightweight WordPress social sharing and following that doesn’t add any unnecessary burden to your site and especially on your users.

What sets WordPress Social Media Feather aside from the plethora of other social sharing and following WordPress plugins is its focus on simplicity, performance and unobtrusive impact.

In order to achieve this the plugin makes no use of JavaScript and as a consequence it’s **really fast** while still providing all the social media functionality you might need.

By keeping load times at a minimum, you ensure that all the social sharing aspects of your site don’t interfere with those visitors who just want to access the content but are not interested in sharing on social platforms.

On the other hand, given the widespread focus on WordPress social media integration, your site will still provide social bookmarks to improve visibility of your posts and content and improve your overall global reach.

The **WordPress social media sharing** offered by the plugin includes all major social sharing providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, reddit, Pinterest, tumblr, Linkedin and even e-mail.

It will show social buttons that your users can click to share to facebook or tweet your posts and pages on your site or submit it to reddit and google plus and all other social sharing networks.

The **WordPress social media following** offered by the plugin includes all major social network providers and tools like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, tumblr, instagram, flickr, foursquare, vimeo or RSS.

The plugin also offers widgets for sharing and following buttons that you can place in any widgetized area in your site. Widgets also expose some settings to tweak appearance.

You can disable automatic rendering of social icons for specific posts by using *Custom Fields*. Simply set a custom field of `synved_social_exclude_share` to "yes" (without quotes) to disable rendering of sharing buttons on the post/page or `synved_social_exclude_follow` to "yes" (without quotes) to remove following buttons from the post or alternatively `synved_social_exclude` to disable both.

= Example Shortcodes =

This shortcode will create a list of social sharing buttons to share content on your site:
`[feather_share]`

This shortcode will create a list of social sharing buttons to share content on your site using the "Wheel" icons skin:
`[feather_share skin="wheel"]`

This shortcode will create a list of social sharing buttons to share content on your site using the "Wheel" icons skin with a size of 64 pixels:
`[feather_share skin="wheel" size="64"]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social following buttons that allow visitors to follow you:
`[feather_follow]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social following buttons that allow visitors to follow you, using the "Balloon" icons skin:
`[feather_follow skin="balloon"]`

The next shortcode will create a list of social following buttons that allow visitors to follow you, using the "Balloon" icons skin with a size of 64 pixels:
`[feather_follow skin="balloon" size="64"]`

= Template Tags =

If you don't want to use shortcodes but instead prefer to use PHP directly, there are 2 PHP functions/template tags you can use.

For sharing buttons you can use:
`if (function_exists('synved_social_share_markup')) synved_social_share_markup();`

For following buttons you can use:
`if (function_exists('synved_social_follow_markup')) synved_social_follow_markup();`
