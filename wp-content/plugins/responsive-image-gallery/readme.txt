A responsive gallery which always fits your screen and never looks dull.

This plugin is the combination of collagePlus jquery image gallery and Fancybox image gallery. This plugin is responsive
and always fits your screen width. You can use the short codes provided, to put the gallery anywhere you want. The
options for the shortcodes is available at the admin panel. 

The gallery can be displayed as single gallery, multiple gallery or all the gallery that the users have created.

The images are uploaded from the media manager of wordpress so that the users dont have to upload images multiple times. 
Then user can go to the responsive gallery interface and select which images to be assigned to what galery. It is pretty simple 
and user friendly.
